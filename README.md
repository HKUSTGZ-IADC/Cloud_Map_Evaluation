# Cloud_Map_Evaluation
Point cloud map evaluation library  for the FusionPortable dataset.  Metrics include RMSE, Accuracy(mean error), Precision(standard deviation), completeness(overlap ratio), chamfer distance(MD) and F1-score at all levels of 1cm/2cm/5cm/10cm/20cm.

## Dependencies

- *[Open3d 0.16](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D)* 

 

we have a point cloud map generated by a pose-slam system, and we have a ground truth point cloud map. Then we caculate related metrics.

We can also get a rendered distance-error map in this process, the color R->G->B represent for the distance error at a level of 0-10cm.
